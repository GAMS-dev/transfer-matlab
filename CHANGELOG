GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.3.0
==================
- Changed behaviour of default records: Default records don't get written to GDX
  anymore if either the container is in indexed mode or if the symbol has a
  regular domain.
- Categoricals for record domain labels are now created with `Ordinal` set to
  `true`, but ordinal categoricals are not enforced, i.e. users may pass
  categoricals with `Ordinal` set to `false`.
- Added possibility to filter UEL IDs in `getUELs`.
- Deprecated `getUELLabels`. Use `getUELs` instead.
