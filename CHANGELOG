GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.3.0
==================
- Breaking: Symbol name uniqueness is now checked case insensitively. For
  example, it is not possible anymore to have two different symbols named
  `symbol` and `Symbol` or `SYMBOL`.
- Added method `Container.getSymbolNames` to return the original symbol names
  for a list of symbol names of any case.
- Added method `Container.hasSymbols` to check if symbol name (case insensitive)
  exists.
- Changed `Container.getSymbols`, `Container.removeSymbol`,
  `Container.renameSymbol`, `Container.describe*` and others that use
  `Container.getSymbols` to accept symbol names case insensitively.
- Changed behaviour of default records: Default records don't get written to GDX
  anymore if either the container is in indexed mode or if the symbol has a
  regular domain.
- Changed behaviour of `getDomainViolations`: As in GDX different character case
  does not lead to a domain violation.
- Categoricals for record domain labels are now created with `Ordinal` set to
  `true`, but ordinal categoricals are not enforced, i.e. users may pass
  categoricals with `Ordinal` set to `false`.
- Changed symbol read order when reading a subset of symbols: Symbol order is
  defined by source order (e.g. symbol order in GDX file) rather than user
  supplied order. To establish a custom order after the read, use
  `reorderSymbols`.
- Added possibility to filter UEL IDs in `Symbol.getUELs`.
- Deprecated `Symbol.getUELLabels`. Use `Symbol.getUELs` instead.
- Fixed `Symbol.transformRecords` (table-like to matrix-like formats) in case
  the domain set records and UELs differ.
- Fixed write of sets defined over sets.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.2
==================
- Fixed read of equation with unknown subtype (recast as `=e=`).
- Fixed partial read of symbols in indexed container.
- Fixed `equals` method in indexed container.
- Fixed possible segfault when reading a subset of symbols as dense matrix with
  at least one scalar symbol.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.1
==================
- Fixed read of variable with unknown subtype (recast as free).
- Fixed check of variable type on variable creation.
- Fixed `isEps`, `isNA` and `isUndef` of `SpecialValues` for sparse matrix input.
- Fixed default values of external, conic and boolean equations.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.0
==================
- Added documentation.
- Added "equals" method to Container and Symbol classes to compare containers or.
  symbols.
- Added "copy" method to Symbol classes to copy symbols to another container.
- Added support to read symbols directly from non-const container.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.1.0
