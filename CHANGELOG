GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.3.0
==================
- Breaking: Symbol name uniqueness is now checked case insensitively. For
  example, it is not possible anymore to have two different symbols named
  `symbol` and `Symbol` or `SYMBOL`.
- Breaking: Changed `Symbol.addUELs` signature from `addUELs(dim, uels)` to
  `addUELs(uels, dim)`. `dim` is now allowed to accept a vector of dimensions.
- Breaking: Changed `Symbol.setUELs` signature from `setUELs(dim, uels)` to
  `setUELs(uels, dim)` and `setUELS(_, 'rename', true/false)`. Setting `rename`
  to `true` triggers the old `Symbol.initUELs`. `dim` is now allowed to accept a
  vector of dimensions.
- Breaking: Changed `Symbol.removeUELs` signature from `removeUELs(dim, uels)`
  to `removeUELs()`, `removeUELs(uels)` and `removeUELs(uels, dim)`. `dim` is
  now allowed to accept a vector of dimensions.
- Breaking: Changed `Symbol.renameUELs` signature from `renameUELs(dim, olduels,
  newuels)` to `renameUELs(uels)` and `renameUELs(uels, dim)`. `uels` can now be
  `cellstr`, `struct` or `containers.Map`. `dim` is now allowed to accept a
  vector of dimensions.
- Added method `Container.getSymbolNames` to return the original symbol names
  for a list of symbol names of any case.
- Added method `Container.hasSymbols` to check if symbol name (case insensitive)
  exists.
- Added method `Container.getUELs` to get UELs from all symbols.
- Added method `Container.removeUELs` to remove UELs from all symbols.
- Added method `Container.renameUELs` to rename UELs in all symbols.
- Added method `Symbol.reorderUELs` to reorder UELs without changing the meaning
  of records.
- Added flags `Container.modified` and `Symbol.modified` to indicate if a
  container and/or symbol has been modified since last reset.
- Added possibility to filter UEL codes in `Symbol.getUELs`.
- Added possibility to pass a vector of dimensions to `Symbol.getUELs`.
- Added possibility to overwrite symbols with `Container.add*` if main symbol
  definition (e.g. type, domain) is equal.
- Changed `Container.getSymbols`, `Container.removeSymbol`,
  `Container.renameSymbol`, `Container.describe*` and others that use
  `Container.getSymbols` to accept symbol names case insensitively.
- Changed behaviour of default records: Default records do not get written to
  GDX anymore if the records format is `dense_matrix` and either the container
  is in indexed mode or if the symbol has a regular domain.
- Changed behaviour of `getDomainViolations`: As in GDX different character case
  does not lead to a domain violation.
- Categoricals for record domain labels are now created with `Ordinal` set to
  `true`, but ordinal categoricals are not enforced, i.e. users may pass
  categoricals with `Ordinal` set to `false`.
- Changed symbol read order when reading a subset of symbols: Symbol order is
  defined by source order (e.g. symbol order in GDX file) rather than user
  supplied order. To establish a custom order after the read, use
  `reorderSymbols`.
- Deprecated `Symbol.getUELLabels`. Use `Symbol.getUELs` instead.
- Deprecated `Symbol.initUELs`. Use `Symbol.setUELs` instead.
- Deprecated `Container.getUniverseSet`. Use `Container.getUELs` instead.
- Fixed failing symbol constructors when using `domain_forwarding`, but none of
  the optional arguments.
- Fixed `Symbol.transformRecords` (table-like to matrix-like formats) in case
  the domain set records and UELs differ.
- Fixed write of sets defined over sets.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.2
==================
- Fixed read of equation with unknown subtype (recast as `=e=`).
- Fixed partial read of symbols in indexed container.
- Fixed `equals` method in indexed container.
- Fixed possible segfault when reading a subset of symbols as dense matrix with
  at least one scalar symbol.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.1
==================
- Fixed read of variable with unknown subtype (recast as free).
- Fixed check of variable type on variable creation.
- Fixed `isEps`, `isNA` and `isUndef` of `SpecialValues` for sparse matrix input.
- Fixed default values of external, conic and boolean equations.

GAMS Transfer Matlab v0.2.0
==================
- Added documentation.
- Added "equals" method to Container and Symbol classes to compare containers or.
  symbols.
- Added "copy" method to Symbol classes to copy symbols to another container.
- Added support to read symbols directly from non-const container.
